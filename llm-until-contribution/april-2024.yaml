    activities:
      - completed lesson 3 of fastai
      - started C++ OLS classifier
    thoughts:
      - trying to have a few ml models iterated on this week from scratch
      - a lot of the indirect work required is figuring out the next steps -- surveying papers, exploring ideas, etc.

    activites:
      - completed lesson 5 of fastai ('from-scratch model')
      - build out a few neural nets using pytorch
      - curious about the internals of ml frameworks so maybe a deep dive into repos like {autograd, micrograd, tf, pytorch, etc} is in store
